[Why 'random' shuffle feels far from random](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/why-random-shuffle-feels-far-from-random-10066621.html)

## What I Found Interesting

I found the disparity between true randomness and percieved randomness between engineers and end users to be interesting. True random actually led to more coincidences between adjacent songs in a playlist, leading end users to believe that thier songs were not being played in a random order. Spotify engineers developed an algorithm that spaced out songs by at least 25% intervals to make their random algorithm **appear** more random to combat this.
