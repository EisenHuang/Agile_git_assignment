[Why 'random' shuffle feels far from random](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/why-random-shuffle-feels-far-from-random-10066621.html)

## What I Found Interesting

I found the disparity between true randomness and percieved randomness between engineers and end users to be interesting. True random actually led to more coincidences between adjacent songs in a playlist, leading end users to believe that thier songs were not being played in a random order. Spotify engineers developed an algorithm that spaced out songs by at least 25% intervals to make their random algorithm **appear** more random to combat this.

##Eisen's Rsponse
I think its interesting that sometimes people think its not random but it actaully is. True randomness can sometimes be "not random at all" if the song got shuffled twice even it's actually randomly generated. It is interesting how true randomness should be defined.

## Gambler's Fallacy [Ann's Thoughts]
The article mentions Gambler's Fallacy as the main reason for the old random algorithm appearing non random. Gambler's Fallacy describes the human brain's tendency to expect something to happen again if it hasn't happened in a while. It is interesting because engineering power was spent on trying to defeat the tricks our brain plays on us.
